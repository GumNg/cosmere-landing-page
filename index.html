        <p>The Cosmere is the fictional universe created by Brandon Sanderson for many of his fantasy novels to take place. All of his Cosmere books share a single creation myth, a single cosmology, that gives underlying theorem of magic for all these connected worlds. Since all the worlds in the Cosmere are connected, certain characters from one series sometimes show up in other series. So pay attention!</p>
